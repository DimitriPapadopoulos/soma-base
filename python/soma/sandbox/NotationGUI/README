To run the GUI:
- in the same folder the files: read_csv.py and notationGUI.py
- command line: python notationGUI.py
- choose a picutre (.png) in a directory and then all the picutre in this directory are available with the button '>' and '<' (next and prev picture)
- the name of the picture is written in the command line
- a file data.csv is created with the note and comments for the picture associated

Faster use:
in notationGUI.py, line 16: self.dirname= '/yourdirectory' (you can change the path for the current directory)
